The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find a revised version of my [Mini Project 01](https://rpubs.com/Krvera7522/913722), which was completed to demonstrate the development of skills learned throughout the course, and to put into practice the principles of data visualization explored through different provided materials. The data frame used for the analysis is “marathon_results_2017.csv”, provided by Professor Rei Sanchez. This data contained information about the finishers of the Boston marathon of 2017. In my analysis, questions such as the list below were answer. To learn more about the findings please check it out!

  1. What relationships can be found among Sex, Age, and Pace?
  2. What is the distribution of participants around the world?
  3. What is the impact of age on pace and official time?

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I wanted to expand my understanding of the data through interactive plots, spatial, linear and coefficient model visualizations. The dataset used for the analysis is "marathon_results_2017.csv”, same as project 1. To further understand and interact with the data I asked myself a series of questions:

  1. What relationships can be found among Age and Pace?
  2. What is the distribution of participants around the world?
  3. What is the impact of age on pace and official time?
  
  You can find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder to learn more about my work in this project.
